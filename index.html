    <h1>Zen Garden Activities</h1>
    <p>The Zen Garden at MDC Padron Campus serves as a peaceful retreat where students can engage in various hands-on activities that promote creativity, sustainability, and 
        relaxation. Participants in the garden contribute by planting small plants, flowers, and vegetables, fostering a greener environment while learning about sustainable 
        gardening practices. In addition to planting, students can express their artistic side by painting decorative elements such as garden stones and signs, adding a unique 
        touch to the space. The garden also serves as an inspiration for designing and enhancing green areas around campus, allowing students to take an active role in creating 
        eco-friendly spaces. Through these activities, the Zen Garden becomes a hub for environmental awareness, artistic expression, and community collaboration.

    <h1>Zen Garden and Eco Club Team</h1>
    <p>The members of the Zen Garden naturally come together, each bringing their own strengths to create a peaceful and balanced space. Whether it's shaping the sand, caring for 
        the plants, or just ensuring the overall vibe stays calm, everyone plays a part in maintaining the serenity of the garden. There's a real sense of respect and trust among 
        the group, with everyone open to sharing ideas and supporting each other. This teamwork feels effortless, almost like second nature, as they work toward a common goal. It’s 
        this collaboration that makes the Zen Garden more than just a space—it becomes a reflection of mindfulness and balance, where each person’s contribution adds to the greater 
        whole.</p>
